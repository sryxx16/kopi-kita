# Efficiency vs. Hype — Choose Stable, Not Shiny

## The Dependency Decision Framework

Before adding ANY dependency, answer these 5 questions:

### 1. Can You Do It Without a Library? (The stdlib-first Rule)
```
❌ OVER-ENGINEERING:
npm install is-odd        # 1 line of code: n % 2 !== 0
npm install left-pad      # Already in String.prototype.padStart
npm install is-number     # typeof x === 'number' && !isNaN(x)
npm install array-flatten # Array.prototype.flat() exists since ES2019

✅ USE THE LANGUAGE:
const isOdd = (n: number) => n % 2 !== 0;
const padded = str.padStart(10, '0');
const flat = nested.flat(Infinity);
```

**Dependency Defense:** If the user asks to install a new library, or if you feel the need to use one, evaluate it against the "stdlib-first" rule. If the functionality can be implemented safely in under 20 lines of code, write it yourself. If a dependency is strictly necessary, you MUST justify it by providing its bundle size, maintenance status, and why the standard library is insufficient.

### 2. Is It Maintained? (The Pulse Check)
| Signal | 🟢 Healthy | 🔴 Dead |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Last commit | < 6 months ago | > 2 years ago |
| Open issues | Actively triaged | 500+ unread |
| Downloads/week | Growing or stable | Declining |
| Bus factor | > 3 maintainers | 1 maintainer, inactive |
| Security | No known CVEs | Unpatched vulnerabilities |

**Rule:** If a library has a bus factor of 1 and no commit in 12+ months, it is a risk. Find an alternative or vendor-fork it.

### 3. What's the Cost? (The Weight Check)
```
Before: npm install moment     # 289KB minified, entire library for date formatting
After:  npm install date-fns   # 12KB for just the functions you use (tree-shakeable)
Better: Intl.DateTimeFormat    # 0KB — built into the runtime
```

**Rule:** Check the bundle impact. Use [bundlephobia.com](https://bundlephobia.com) for JS packages. If a library adds > 50KB to your bundle for a simple feature, find a lighter alternative or implement it yourself.

### 4. Is It the Community Standard? (The Ecosystem Rule)
Prefer packages that the ecosystem has settled on:

| Need | ✅ Standard | ❌ Avoid |
|------|-----------|---------|
| HTTP client (Node) | `undici` (built-in) / native `fetch` / `ky` | `axios` (declining, CVE-2025-58754, bloated) |
| Validation | `zod` | `joi` (heavier), `yup` (less type-safe) |
| ORM (Node) | `prisma`, `drizzle` | `sequelize` (legacy API), `typeorm` (decorator hell) |
| Date handling | `date-fns`, `dayjs`, `Temporal` (when stable) | `moment` (deprecated, massive) |
| Testing | `vitest` (new projects), `jest` (existing) | `mocha` + `chai` + `sinon` (3 deps for what 1 does) |
| Password hashing | `argon2` (OWASP primary), `bcrypt` (legacy) | Custom crypto (NEVER) |
| Env loading | `dotenv` (if needed) | Custom `.env` parser |

**Note:** These are current recommendations as of March 2026. Evaluate against this framework; don't blindly follow.

### 5. Can You Remove It Later? (The Exit Strategy)
```
❌ HIGH LOCK-IN:
// Decorators from a specific framework scattered across 200 files
@Controller() @Injectable() @Guard() // In every file — framework is your entire architecture

✅ LOW LOCK-IN:
// Framework stays at the edges; business logic is framework-free
// Switching from Express to Fastify only changes the transport layer
```

**Rule:** Wrap external dependencies that touch > 5 files. If you need to replace a library, it should only affect the wrapper, not your entire codebase.

## The Hype Trap (AI-Generated Code Alert)

AI agents love suggesting trendy libraries because they appear frequently in training data. Watch for:

### Red Flags
1. **"Just install X"** without explaining why → ASK: Can I do this with the stdlib?
2. **Library does one thing** that's 5 lines of code → REJECT: Write it yourself
3. **Library is in alpha/beta** with < 1 year of releases → REJECT: Not production-ready
4. **Library has a cooler API** but the current one works fine → REJECT: "Cool" is not a business requirement
5. **"Everyone is using it"** → SO WHAT: Popularity is not a quality signal

### The Agent Must Justify Dependencies
When an AI agent suggests adding a new dependency, it MUST provide:
```
📦 DEPENDENCY JUSTIFICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Package: [name@version]
Purpose: [what it does in 1 sentence]
Stdlib Alternative: [why it's insufficient — or "none"]
Bundle Size: [minified + gzipped]
Maintenance: [last release date, maintainer count]
Lock-in Risk: [low/medium/high — how many files would it touch]
Exit Strategy: [how to remove it if needed]
```

## Dependency Update Strategy

1. **Pin exact versions** in lockfiles (already default with package-lock.json, bun.lockb)
2. **Review changelogs** before major updates — never blindly `npm update`
3. **Update in isolation** — one dependency per PR, with tests passing
4. **Security patches immediately** — don't wait for the sprint
5. **Monthly audit** — run `npm audit` / `bun audit` and address findings

---

## The Zero-Dependency Ideal

The best packages are those with zero or minimal dependencies themselves:
- `zod` — 0 dependencies ✅
- `date-fns` — 0 dependencies ✅
- `nanoid` — 0 dependencies ✅
- `bcrypt` — 1 native dependency (justified for crypto) ✅

A package that pulls in 50 transitive dependencies for a simple feature is a supply chain attack waiting to happen.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do I need this functionality?
  → No → Don't install anything
  → Yes ↓

Can I write it in < 20 lines?
  → Yes → Write it yourself
  → No ↓

Does the language/runtime provide it?
  → Yes → Use the built-in
  → No ↓

Is there a well-maintained, lightweight, community-standard package?
  → Yes → Install it, add justification comment
  → No → Build a minimal internal implementation, consider vendoring
```
